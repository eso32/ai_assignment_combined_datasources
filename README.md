# AI Project - combined datasources 

This is a course project (AI assignment) where the goal is to merge data from three different sources:
1. Clients – stored in a database (zad_domowe__clients.db, table clients).
1. Products – stored in a CSV file (zad_domowe__products.csv).
1. Invoices/Orders – available only as screenshots (zad_domowe__invoice_1.png, zad_domowe__invoice_2.png, etc.).

Your task is to combine these into a single CSV containing client, product, and invoice details. The file should include only the necessary columns with no duplicates.

Each row should represent a purchased product with its quantity, client, and unit price.
